# CUSAT Smart Campus  
### Digital Library Seat Management System

---

## 📌 Project Overview

CUSAT Smart Campus is a Flutter-based mobile application designed to optimize library seat management at Cochin University of Science and Technology (CUSAT).

The application enables students to scan a QR code inside the library, reserve available seats, and automatically start a timed session. Once the session expires, the system automatically checks out the student and releases the seat.

This ensures fair usage, prevents seat blocking, and improves overall resource efficiency.
